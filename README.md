Disaster Tweet Classifier

Description

This repository houses the code and resources for a machine learning system that classifies tweets as disaster-related or not. It's designed to automate tweet categorization, assisting in disaster response efforts.

Project Goals

Develop a deep learning model for accurate disaster tweet classification.
Build a user-friendly Flask web application to enable real-time tweet classification.
Participate in the Kaggle NLP Getting Started competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data).

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Required Libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

libraries installed using pip install <library_name>.

Installation:

Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/chapachandi/disaster-tweet-classifier.git
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Running the Project (Command-Line - Optional):


Running the Project (Flask Web App):

Follow command-line installation steps.

Start the Flask development server:

Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
This will run the Flask app, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

Use the Web Interface:

The web app will likely provide a form or mechanism to submit tweet text for classification in real-time. Interact with the web interface to classify tweets as disaster-related or not.

Input Data in frontent:
disaster tweets 
    "There's a massive fire in my neighborhood! #fire #help",
    "Flooding is severe in my town. Roads are impassable. #flood #disaster",

non disaster tweets 
    "Happy birthday to my best friend!",
    "Just finished watching a great movie. #weekendvibes",
