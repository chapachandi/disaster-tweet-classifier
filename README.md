# Disaster Tweet Classifier

## Description

This repository houses the code and resources for a machine learning system that classifies tweets as disaster-related or not. It's designed to automate tweet categorization, assisting in disaster response efforts.

## Project Goals

Develop a deep learning model for accurate disaster tweet classification.
Build a user-friendly Flask web application to enable real-time tweet classification.
Participate in the Kaggle NLP Getting Started competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data).

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Required Libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

libraries installed using 
```
pip install <library_name>.
```

## Installation:

**Clone this repository:**

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/chapachandi/disaster-tweet-classifier.git
```
Use code with caution.

**Install dependencies:**

Bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Use code with caution.
Running the Project (Command-Line - Optional):


## Running the Project (Flask Web App):

Follow command-line installation steps.

**Start the Flask development server:**

Bash
```
python app.py
```
Use code with caution.
This will run the Flask app, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

**Use the Web Interface:**

The web app will likely provide a form or mechanism to submit tweet text for classification in real-time. Interact with the web interface to classify tweets as disaster-related or not.

**Input Data in frontent:**

**disaster tweets**
- There's a massive fire in my neighborhood! #fire #help
- Flooding is severe in my town. Roads are impassable. #flood #disaster

**non disaster tweets** 
- Happy birthday to my best friend!
- Just finished watching a great movie. #weekendvibes
